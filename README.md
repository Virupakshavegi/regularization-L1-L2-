# regularization-L1-L2-
Steps:-
oad the dataset.
perform pre-processing on the data.
remove registered feature and keep the casual feature to understand data leakage.
construct train and test dataset.
create a linear regression model.
check the r2 score of the initial linear regression model on train and test dataset
observe distribution of weights in the initial linear regression model.
split the dataset into k consecutive folds.
School of Computer Science Engineering and Technology
calculate cross validation score for the k fold and check how well our model can generalize on the training
dataset.
checking the variance threshold of dataset and remove features with low variance.
apply L1 regularization on the dataset and check the r2_score.
visualize the distribution of weights on the lasso regression model.
apply L2 regularization on the dataset and check the r2_score.
visualize the distribution of weights on the ridge regression model.
